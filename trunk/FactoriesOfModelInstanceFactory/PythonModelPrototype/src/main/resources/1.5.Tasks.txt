 
Here are the list of tasks for Python. Forgot to send them since after noon.

Advanced stuff we will handle in next version.

I.  Connection

    1.  Only one connection per thread and hold the process object
    2.  Each partition should have its own state (if we have any)
    3.  Starting Py server using below arguments

        i.  Host
        ii. Port
        iii.PythonPath
        iv. UniqStringForEachProcess -- Should be associated to thread & PORT

    4. Invoke .Py server Script instead of Shell Script?
     
    5. Reconnect if old connection is bad. If the Py server goes down, restart it and then establish new connection.

    6. While shutting down Kamanja, we need to close all Py connections & servers

 
II. Protocol

    1. We should have some protocol in communicating between Kamanja Scala model & Py connection. The following is the protocol. We always use JSON data transfer.

        a. The message byte array passed to and fro has these segments: 
            i.    <StartMarker> 
            ii.   <DataLen>
            iii.  <JsonData>
            iv.   <EndMarker>

        b.  The markers are currently md5 hashes based upon the <JsonData> string (i.e., sans <DataLen>).
        c.  The <DataLen> is a 4 byte representation of the length of the
        <JsonData> string.
        d.  The <StartMarker> and <EndMarker> should have the same value.  The
        python server will compute its own md5 hash and compare with the markers.  If they do not match an error message is both logged and returned as the result.
        e.  The <JsonData> itself is a map.  In addition to the message integrity checks, to be successfully processed, a key must be found in the map == 'cmd' whose value is the command that will interpret the remaining key/value pairs in the dictionary. Should the 'cmd' key value not refer to a legitimate command,  an error is logged and returned.
        f.  Kamanja uses ByteBuffer to encode the data for transmission to the PythonServer.  As used all numerical data is encoded in Big Endian order, the conventional network order.

    2. If we pass big data, it will be written into local file in kamanaja scala model and then read data in Py server from file

    3.  Serialization & Deserialization

        i.  From Scala to Py => Serialize Message to Dictionary json at Scala model and Deserialize it into Map in Py model.

        ii. From Py to Scala => Serialize Map into Json and deseirialize it into Msg from JSON in scala.


III. Metadata Commands

    1.  Add Model
        a.  Kamanja scala model writes in PythonPath (when Model Factory is initialized) and give that file path to add command argument (Assuming same path can be shared between all instances)
        b.  Load model into Py server.

    2.  Remove Model 
        a.  Pass model name to remvoe to Py server
        b.  Unload Py model from Py server

    3.  Update Model.  For now either we support update model or we support remove & add.

    4.  Model Runtime commands:
        a. Init (Advanced)

            i.       Initialize model with Model metadata (Ex: Training Output - Model). This data can be written into local file and send the file to Py to load the data.
            ii.      Parameters required here are Model Name & Data File
        b. Execute
            i.       Executing Model with the given message (only one message) and also returns a message. Need to have some special communication if model does not return anything.
            ii.      Parameters required here are Model Name & Message Dictionary. And return value is Dictionary of output Message, which will be deserialized into

    5.Communication From Py Model (server) to Kamanja (Advanced):
        a. Need to add some communication from Py model to Kamanja for the following:
          - Models can request additional data when needed
          - Models can cache state if needed.
        b. Implement shared cache between Py & Kamanja.

 
{
  "Cmd": "Add Model",
  "CmdOptions": {
    "ModelFile": "a.py"
  },
  "ModelOptions": {}
}
 

 1) annotate tasks/ break apart into finer portions if possible, 
 2) fix loop on server, 
 3) add exception handling to server, 
 4) fix message sent ... begin marker, protocol version, checksum, cmd payload length, cmd payload, end marker, 
 5) fix sample models to consume dictionary values passed at model instantiation, 
 6) fix msg at execute to be dictionary as well (this will be created or extracted from scala msg instance on the proxy side and made into json dict for now)
